# Registry #

## Info ##

I have written two other Windows Registry binary parsers that have not been released publicly, this is the third. 

Registry is a .Net 4 compatible port of Willi Ballenthin's [python-registry](https://github.com/williballenthin/python-registry) project. 

It is currently used in the shimcacheparser project. [https://github.com/woanware/Registry](https://github.com/woanware/Registry)
